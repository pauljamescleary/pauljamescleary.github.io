I have been doing software development for 20 years.  My background is pretty diverse having been a developer, architect, consulting, director, and solutions engineer.  Nowadays I spend most of my time writing code and generally planing in the Scala space.

I am by no means a Functional Programming expert, most of my background is in OO using Java and fun things like Spring.  I have been hacking on Scala for over 4 years now, and have done some deep dives into things like _Monads_, but I don't have this "FP First" kind of mindset to development (at least not yet).
